# Machine-Learning-Clustering
Mini_Project_Clustering

Background:
In this post I'm going to talk about something that's relatively simple but fundamental to just about any business: Customer Segmentation. At the core of customer segmentation is being able to identify different types of customers and then figure out ways to find more of those individuals so you can... you guessed it, get more customers! In this post, I'll detail how you can use K-Means clustering to help with some of the exploratory aspects of customer segmentation.

Data:
The dataset contains information on marketing newsletters/e-mail campaigns (e-mail offers sent to customers) and transaction level data from customers. The transactional data shows which offer customers responded to, and what the customer ended up buying. The data is presented as an Excel workbook containing two worksheets. Each worksheet contains a different dataset.

Basic concepts learned include: K-Means Clustering, the Elboy Sum-of-Squares Method, the Silhouette Method, looping over variables to choose appropriate values of K, Visualizing Clusters using PCA, and exploring clustering algorithms (e.g. Affinity Propagation, Spectral clustering, Agglomerative clustering, DBSCAN).
